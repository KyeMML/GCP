# Data Wharehouses
Data warehouses consolidate data into a central repository under a schema and makes it available for querying and data processing. Where data lakes focussed on uniting raw data from sources, data warehouses focus on the consolidation of available data into orngaised and understood frameworks to provide fast and immediate querying or processing.  This means data is clean, accurate and consistent. Google cloud provides BigQuery as a data warehouse solution.
