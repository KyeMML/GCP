### Introduction to Big Query
Bigquery provides two fundamental resources:
1. SQL Query Enginer (Query Service)
2. Managed storage for datasets (Storage Service)

Big Query is serverless, meaning it is fully managed. This means it can auto-scale to a given storage and query. 
The datasets in Big Query is contained within projects. You can navigate this with your project ID.

This can be connected to other services with dataproc/dataflow to build pipelines. 

Controlling resource consumption and costs can be facilitated by optimising what data is contained in the query.
